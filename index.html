                <h1>Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest and most diverse cuisines in the world. Two thousand years before the beginning of our era, people there ate noodles. Even today each province – there are twenty-three in total – has its own cooking style, based on regional ingredients and preferences. These range from wildly picked greens in the mountains and fresh, salty seafood on the northeast coast to the light, sweet accents of Cantonese cuisine. In Central China, where chilli peppers are rampant, people love hot spicy food, while in Beijing, lamb is a favourite.
